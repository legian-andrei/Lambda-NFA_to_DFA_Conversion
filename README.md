# Lambda-NFA_to_DFA_Conversion
This repository contains an implementation for transforming a Lambda-NFA (Non-deterministic Finite Automaton with Lambda transitions) into a DFA (Deterministic Finite Automaton). The project aims to provide a mechanism to convert complex Lambda-NFAs into simpler DFAs for efficient state representation and analysis.
## Project Overview
The implemented solution offers the following functionalities:

**Lambda-NFA Transformation**: Conversion of a Lambda-NFA with its states, transitions, and lambda movements into an equivalent DFA.

**Deterministic Finite Automaton Representation**: Generation of the resulting DFA illustrating its states, transitions, and final/accepting states.
